I set up this project in a really excessively complicated way using Git, and made this repository to make it a little easier to see how the project progressed and our contributions (Also github is really cool).
  
## Usage:
  
I provided a zip file containing the build project as well as the project compiled to a JAR, but you could also download the project from Github and compile it yourself if you would prefer.
  
Upon starting the app, it will ask you to input the recipe you want, and will handle the event of a typo or invalid token.  It will then ask for the amount of people being served, then return the recipe with all of the calculated values.  The app then will then prompt the user to decide if they wish to re-run the program or exit, for which the user the user will either click _enter_ or type _exit_ respectively.
